#Java Compiler Helper

Javach has a command line interface that works similar to javac, but it outputs better error messages for the ones that it handles.

There is also a rudimentary BlueJ plugin for it that simply outputs the messages to a window instead of the command line.

## Files

* `build.bat` - Used to build the command line program
* `javach.bat` - Helper script to run the javach program
* `tests/` - This folder contains source files with errors to run against
