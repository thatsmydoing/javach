BlueJ Processor

The processor currently does not have a pretty interface or anything remotely useful. As of now, it gets data from the database as generated by the BlueJ Browser. The included script automatically gets 100 entries per error type and passes it to the processor to use, these are then stored in separate text files per error type.

Files:

gen.bat             - Windows batch script for running the processor (described above)
gen.sh              - Linux shell script for running the processor
bluej.db            - Database generated by the BlueJ Browser
sqlitejdbc-v056.jar - SQLite library for Java
